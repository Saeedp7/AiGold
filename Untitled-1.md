Security:
The Django secret key is exposed in settings.py. This should be moved to an environment variable.
DEBUG is set to True in settings.py. This should be False in production.
ALLOWED_HOSTS is set to ['*'], which is not secure for production. It should be set to specific hostnames.
Database:
Database credentials are hardcoded in settings.py. These should be moved to environment variables.
Payment Integration:
The Zarinpal merchant ID is hardcoded and commented as 'your_merchant_id'. This should be replaced with the actual ID and stored in an environment variable.
